Introduction  \\nCentral banks have a mandate for monetary and financial stabi lity in their jurisdictions and, explicitly or \\nimplicitly, to promote broad access to safe and efficient payments. A core instrument by which central \\nbanks carry out their public policy objectives is providing the safest form of money to banks, businesses \\nand the public – central bank money.  \\nThis money acts as a means of payment, unit of account and store of value for a jurisdiction. A \\ncommon unit of account is a public good that allows goods and services to be exchanged and financial \\ntransactions to be settled efficiently and safely. Today, central banks provide money to the public through \\ncash and to banks and other financial companies through reserve and settlement accounts. In this way, \\nsome of the smallest and largest payments in an economy are carried  out using central bank money. Yet \\nthe ongoing digitalisation of the economy is changing the way people pay. The use of cash, currently the \\nonly form of central bank money available to the public, is falling in many jurisdictions. The Covid -19 \\npandemic may  be accelerating this trend. Taking cash’s place is private digital money and alternative \\npayment methods.'),\n",

In designing a \\nCBDC ledger, there are five key factors: (i) structure; (ii) payment authentication; (iii) functionality; (iv) \\naccess; and (v) governance.
